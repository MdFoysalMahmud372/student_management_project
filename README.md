## Challenges Faced & Solutions

- **Docker Setup**: Initially, Odoo and PostgreSQL containers didn’t connect. Fixed by correctly mapping ports and volumes.

- **Odoo 16 Compatibility**: Older templates caused issues. Solved by using odoo:16.0 Docker image and updating XML views.

- **Database Connection**: Errors due to wrong credentials. Fixed by setting correct PostgreSQL environment variables.

- **Master Password Issue**: Access denied while creating database. Solved by resetting master password in odoo.conf.

- **Many-to-Many Relation**: Linking students and courses was tricky. Solved by properly using Many2many field in models.

- **Module Visibility**: Module didn’t appear in Apps. Fixed by updating apps list and ensuring 'installable': True.
